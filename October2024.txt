This is my solution for October. My approach was simple.
My initial thoughts when solving the problem was: if I had two similar
paths on the red and blue path, then solving for the equation would be simple.
Additionally, the more multiplication that is required to each another path
makes the variables A, B, and C smaller. Without coding, I found a path that works for
both red and blue which was A-A-B-B-C-C-C. Therefore, the equation that adds up to 2024
would look like (((2A*B)+B)*C+2C)=2024. Breaking down 2024 into it's prime factorization
was: 23 * 11 * 2 * 2 * 2. The following below is how I found values for A, B, C:

 2ABC+BC+2C = 2024
 C(2AB+B+2) = 2024  // To minimize the values, C must be 23
 23(2AB+B+2) = 2024 // This means that 2A+B+2=(11*2^3)

 2AB+B+2 = 88
 2AB+B = 86
 B(2A+1) = 86, (A,B=21,2) is the only combination where A+B+C<50

One potential solution that can better this solution is such that I find a longer symmetric
path and solve for that equation to get a better value of A, B, and C. However, for now,
this is the my solution where A+B+C=45.
